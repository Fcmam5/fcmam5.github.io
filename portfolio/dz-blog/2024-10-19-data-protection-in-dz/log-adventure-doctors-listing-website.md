In this page I'll share an adventure with some Algerian platforms.

## Update 1: Discovering exposed PII on some Algerian platforms (06.02.2024)

One one my relatives (a doctor) found their personal data (name, email, postal address and phone number) exposed on at least two Algerian doctors listing websites.

### Site 1

Initially, I emailed the first platform with their `support@XYZ` email. But it seems that the email address is invalid (I got the following when emailing them):

```
Your email could not be delivered to one or more recipients.
See below for the delivery error and email.

The most common reasons for undelivered email are wrong recipient address or wrong configuration on the recipient mail server.
```

On the same day, I contacted the ANPDP via `contact.anpdp@anpdp.dz` as their reporting platform is still not available, I still see the following ([snapshot from Wayback machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20250206122252/https://anpdp.dz/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A5%D8%AD%D8%AA%D8%AC%D8%A7%D8%AC%D8%8C-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D8%B8%D9%84%D9%91%D9%85-%D9%88-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B4%D9%83%D9%88%D9%89/)):

```
ستضع السلطة الوطنية لاحقا تحت تصرّف الشخص المعني استمارة مُخصّصة لتقديم الاحتجاج أو التظلّم أو الشكوى على مستوى موقعها الالكتروني. www.anpdp.dz .

سيتم لاحقا نشر كيفيات تحويل الاستمارات و تقديم الاحتجاجات و التظلّمات و الشكاوى.
```

### Site 2

The second website belongs to a company who has the [Algerian Startup label](https://startup.dz/), I contacted them on LinkedIn, and by email (I got the address from their contact page).

Few minutes later, I saw that someone from their platform visited my profile on Linkedin:

Let's see how fast (and serious) they'll handle my request before I escalate it.
